# Capstone Proposal

### Name of Student: Gareth Grindeland

### Name of Project: XLerate

### Project's Purpose or Goal: 

_Interactive Fitness E-commerce website to display clothing products, gear, workout plans, supplements, and more._

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
* Fitness themed E-commerce website
* Interactive UI built with React & Next.js
* Ability to view products (clothing, workout plans, supplements, etc.) and navigate between pages to view additional details like price, amount, description.
* Basic webpage styling elements at a minimum. Ideally it is fully styled and responsive.

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* React & Redux
* Next.js Framework
* NoSQL with Firebase / Firestore
* web hosting service (Firebase, AWS, or gh-pages)
* CSS styling library (Bootstrap, MUI, or Tailwind)

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
* Database integration
* Add a cart and checkout widget (potentially integrated with Stripe Checkout or similar API/Library)
* Add ability to sort by category and/or search for a product
* Basic CRUD functionality (a user can add additional items for sale)
* Add smooth animations and scrolling effects using GSAP version 3.0 or other animation libraries. These could be used primarily on a "Featured" section of the website.
* Add a fitness blog section 
* Change which components on the page are loaded server-side, client-side, and hybrid
* Explore nutrition / food APIs integration, potentially add a calorie calculator and data visualization tools


### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
* GSAP version 3.0 + pluggins (i.e. ScrollTrigger and ScrollSmoother)
* React-Spring library, Nivo data vizualization library
* Tailwind CSS
* Spoonacular API (or similar API like Tasty)
* Stripe Checkout


### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
* My goal is to create a functional, fullstack project that is interactive and looks professional, as well as to learn the Next.js framework and further my understanding of React. The theme/name/style of the project may change if something more exciting comes to mind as I get working on this.
